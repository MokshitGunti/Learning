1.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a 
multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed 
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

z=[]
for x in range(2000, 3201):
    a = x%7
    b = x%5
    if a==0 and b!=0:
        z.append(x)
print(z)

2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them
printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

Sol:

a=input('Enter your First name:')
b=input('Enter your Last name:')


print(a[::-1] +' '+ b[::-1])

or

a=input('Enter your First name:')
b=input('Enter your Last name:')

print(b +' '+ a)



3.Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3
Sol:

a=12
r=a/2

v=(4/3) * (22/7) * r*r*r
print("Volume of sphere of diameter 12 is:",v)
